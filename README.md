# Performance Evaluation and Fine-Tuning of a Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This project focuses on the evaluation and fine-tuning of a machine-learning model. The primary objective is to assess the model's performance before and after fine-tuning, utilizing various metrics and visualizations to illustrate the improvements.

## Project Goals
The code in this notebook aims to:
- Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model training.
- Load and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training.
- Train a machine learning model on the dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Fine-tune the model to improve its performance, adjusting hyperparameters as necessary.
- Visualize the model's performance through plots before and after fine-tuning, allowing for a clear comparison of results.

## Contents
- **Exercise-2.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for importing libraries, training the model, evaluating its performance, and fine-tuning.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Requirements
Make sure to have the following packages installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (or any other framework used in the model)
